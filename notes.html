		<dd>DAY 3 of 20 runinng for 10 days in a row, while running i get the same exact feelings. I start motivated => my chest, legs start to hurt =>i get doubt and quiting thoughts but i dissmiss and fight them with counter thoughts! and with the help of music too. running sucks, it hurts every single time, but after finishing i get this high, natural. plus how the fuck will you fight vs life if you can't run 20 minutes</dd>
