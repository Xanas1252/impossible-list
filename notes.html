		<dd>DAY 3 of 20 runinng for 10 days in a row, while running i get the same exact feelings. I start motivated => my chest, legs start to hurt =>i get doubt and quiting thoughts but i dissmiss and fight them with counter thoughts! and with the help of music too. running sucks, it hurts every single time, but after finishing i get this high, natural. plus how the fuck will you fight vs life if you can't run 20 minutes</dd>

		<dd>8 june, i FAILED at keeping the ongoing goal of running daily for 10 days in a row, I failed which is gonna happen alot. growing up, i always saw failing as a pure bad thing which is completly wrong ! i haven't done any done any task since, got motivated and i put about 20 tasks on the active items section because i was stressed and felt bad, i put all those tasks so i can feel good about myself that i might do  all those tasks. I could have done them or i could have failed but yeah now i will deal with this smarter! i will only put taks that are highly beneficial to me especialy the financal ones</dd>
